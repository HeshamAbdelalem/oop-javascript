//# In JavaScript we don't have classes, we only have objects
//# Prototype is essentially a parent of another object
//# every object in JavaScript, except only a single object, has a prototype for parent. And it inherits all the members we find in it's prototype

//## A prototype is just a regular object in memory, EveryObject has a prototype or parent except the root object
